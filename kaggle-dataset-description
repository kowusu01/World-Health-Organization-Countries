The World Health Organization groups the countries it works with into regions. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WHO_regions.
Tne malaria dataset includes the WHO region that thne data is reported from. Since my focus was more on data qualityh rather than analysis of the Malaria cases, I wanted to be able to verify that each data row reported has valid country and correct region.

To achieve this, the folloing approach was followed:

1. scrape the wikipedia site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes for list of countries
2. scrape the wikipedia site https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WHO_regions for list of who regions and countries
3. merge the two together to get a dataset with the following fields:

CountryName

- the name generally used by WHO to refer to the country

LongName

- the official long name the country is often referred to

IsWHOCountry

- a boolean whether or not this counbtry is a WHO country country, i.e. a country WHO workds with

WHORegion

- if the country is a WHO country, this fireld will have the WHOm region for the country, e.g. Amreicas

WHORegionCode

- the region code for the WHO region - e.g. AMR for the American region

WHORegionName

- the full name that can be used in reporting e.g. Region of the Americas

ISO2

- two letter iso code for the country, e.g. US for the United States

ISO3

- three letter iso code for the country, e.g. USA for the United States

ISONum

- the three digit numeric iso number for the country, e.g. "840" for the United States
